## Correlation matrix

### CORRELATION MAGNITUDE DATA SUMMARY

The Correlation Matrix data indicates the following insights:

1. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and CDI (central dipole index) is 1.0, indicating a strong positive correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the CDI also increases.
2. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and NST (Nearshore tsunami) is 0.11311434379917883, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the NST also tends to increase, but not as strongly as the CDI.
3. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and MMI (Magnitude-weighted mean intensity) is 0.28555187372830937, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the MMI also tends to increase, but not as strongly as the CDI.
4. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and SIG (Significance) is 0.5158707313598007, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the SIG also tends to increase, but not as strongly as the CDI.
5. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and LAT (Latitude) is -0.008551563436749123, indicating a weak negative correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the latitude tends to decrease slightly, but not significantly.
6. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and LONG (Longitude) is -0.013910952767835667, indicating a weak negative correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the longitude tends to decrease slightly, but not significantly.
7. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and YEAR (Year) is -0.057083206482915844, indicating a moderate negative correlation. This means that when the magnitude increases, the year tends to decrease slightly, but not significantly.
8. The correlation coefficient between the magnitude and MONTH (Month) is -0.0119259934
